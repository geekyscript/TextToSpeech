# 🧠 Turn Text into Realistic Speech Using Python in 5 Lines!
## 🎙️ Build Your Own AI Voice Generator with `edge-tts`

Have you ever wanted your Python app to **speak** like a human? Not just robotic beeps or lifeless monotone voices—but actual **realistic, human-like speech**?

In this post, I’ll show you how to use a powerful library called `edge-tts` to convert any text into ultra-realistic AI speech, using just **5 lines of Python code**. It's fast, free, and ridiculously simple.

Let’s get started!

## 🧰 What You'll Need

Before we jump in, here’s what you need:

- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection (since the TTS happens via Microsoft’s online engine)
- A few seconds of your time 😉

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Install the `edge-tts` Library

We’re using the `edge-tts` package, which is a wrapper around Microsoft Edge’s neural TTS (Text-to-Speech) service. It gives you access to the **same ultra-realistic voices** used in Azure, but with zero API keys or cost.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install edge-tts
```

That’s it. You’re ready to go!

## ✨ Step 2: Write the Magic Code

Here’s the full working code:

```python
import asyncio
import edge_tts

async def main():
    tts = edge_tts.Communicate("This is a test", "en-US-JennyNeural")
    await tts.save("test.mp3")

asyncio.run(main())
```

Let’s break this down:

- `edge_tts.Communicate(text, voice)` creates the speech object.
- `await tts.save("filename.mp3")` generates and saves the speech as an MP3 file.
- `asyncio.run(main())` kicks off the process.

Save the file as `main.py` and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

💡 **Output:** You’ll get a file called `test.mp3` in the same folder. Open it and listen—it's incredibly realistic!

## 🎤 Step 3: Customize the Voice

Microsoft offers **dozens of voices**, covering different languages, regions, genders, and tones.

To list all available voices, use:

```bash
python -m edge_tts --list-voices
```

This will output a huge list. Some popular ones include:

| Language | Voice Name               | Description             |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| English (US) | `en-US-JennyNeural`      | Natural female voice     |
| English (UK) | `en-GB-RyanNeural`       | Warm male British voice  |
| English (India) | `en-IN-NeerjaNeural`    | Clear Indian accent       |
| Japanese | `ja-JP-NanamiNeural`     | Japanese female voice    |
| Spanish | `es-ES-ElviraNeural`      | Spanish female voice     |

Just replace the voice name in the code:

```python
tts = edge_tts.Communicate("Hola mundo", "es-ES-ElviraNeural")
```

And you're good to go!

## 💡 Use Cases

This simple TTS engine opens up tons of possibilities:

- 🎧 **Narrate articles or blogs**
- 📚 **Generate audiobooks**
- 🤖 **Voice assistants**
- 🎙️ **Podcast automation**
- 📢 **Alert systems or voice UIs**

Want to generate speech from long scripts or text files? Simply read from a file:

```python
with open("script.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read()
```

Then pass `text` to the `Communicate()` function.

## 🛠️ Common Errors

If you see this error:

```
NoAudioReceived: No audio was received. Please verify that your parameters are correct.
```

Here are the usual fixes:

- Check your internet connection.
- Use a valid voice name (`--list-voices` is your friend).
- Upgrade `edge-tts` to the latest version:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade edge-tts
  ```

---

## 📦 Wrapping Up

In just a few lines of Python, you've built a fully working AI voice generator using **Microsoft’s neural speech engine**. The quality is good enough for production-level use—no joke.

Now that you’ve unlocked the power of speech, what will you build next?
